                           		Choose your ginger plant.you  begin by picking up ginger root from a grocery store.</p><br>
                                <p>Prepare the soil before planting ginger.  use high-quality, well-drained soil. A mix of garden soil and well-rotted compost (50/50) is best.</p><br>
                               <p>Divide the original vegetable root up using a sharp, sanitised knife. Any piece that sits at a minimum width of 2.5 to 3.75cm (1 to 1.5 inches).

After dividing up your root plant (pieces with three or more eyes are more likely to sprout), leave the pieces in a safe and dry location for at least a few days – this will allow the ginger pieces to form a protective callus over the surface and heal, reducing the risk of infection. Each piece of cut ginger will require approximately 20cm (8 inches) of space between them.</p>

Using a fine grater, like a microplane zester, shred a few large pieces of ginger.</p>

<p><b>Step 2:</b>Place the grated ginger into a cheesecloth and give it a good squeeze into a bowl, much as you’d squeeze a lemon for juice. If your ginger is nice and fresh, plenty of juice will drip out.

You can also press pieces of fresh ginger into a garlic press to extract juice.</p>

<p><b>Step 3:</b>You can drink your ginger juice directly, or add honey to balance the flavor. If the ginger is too spicy for you, try diluting it with water; hot water turns the ginger concentrate into a tasty tea.</p>
